Theirs was an artistic household.  Henry was educated in the Wiener Werkstadt and was one of the founders of the field of Industrial Design in the U.S.  Elly was a member of the Viennese Dressmakers’ Guild.  Both of them taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  AnneKarin grew up in Northfield IL and graduated from New Trier HS in 1961.  She received her BA in Anthropology from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1966 and joined the Peace Corps that same year.  She served as a Volunteer for three years in Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, where she founded a leather working factory that provided steady work for local shoe makers.  Upon her return she went to Illinois Institute of Technology where she received an MA in Linguistics.
She tolerated the weather in Chicago until 1973 when she moved to San Francisco where Peace Corps friends facilitated her settlement into a new life on the West Coast.  Two months after she arrived she broke her leg in a ski accident and spent 11 months in a cast.  When able to walk again, she pursued a sign painting business which grew into a brokerage for architectural graphics.  From that she moved into print brokering, specializing in 3-D displays.  This enabled her to buy the house she was living in on Potrero Hill in San Francisco.
The recession in 1989 plus the introduction of computer technology into the world of print created a crossroad.  AnneKarin decided to give up the printing business and return to graduate school where she earned a graduate certificate in Educational Therapy.  She specialized in perception/cognition and opened a private practice, helping children and adults with learning disabilities to address the underlying causes of their learning problems.  
During all these years AnneKarin continued to pursue visual art.  Today she works as an artist, focusing on the figure.  When no model is available she enjoys painting still lifes, abstracts, and landscapes.  She has shown her work internationally and in many competitions across the U.S.  She is a member of the Artists’ Guild of San Francisco.

During college, while studying abroad in Germany for a year, I took the opportunity to fly and to rail to 10 of the neighboring European countries.  I've also spent some time traveling solo in South East Asia.  I really enjoy immersing myself in different cultures as I find the challenge especially rewarding.

Traveling and eating my way through the world are my ultimate passions!  That's one of the reasons why I decided to work for a company where I can inspire travelers to explore this great wide world of ours and experience it like a local!

I like the big cities for their diversity in people, energetic airports and mass transit, unique architecture, rooftop vista points, cafe culture, and how could I forget the variety of nomz.  I don't care much for main street shopping or gridlock traffic.

I equally like the unbeaten path for the sense of adventure, learning the local way of life, being able to see more than 10 stars at night, and loving the fact that I'm a little blue dot in the middle of nowhere on G00gle maps.  I'm not a fan of mozzies or sunblock eye sting.

Besides traveling and eating the world, I keep an active lifestyle of hitting the gym and playing tennis and volleyball.  But please don't ask me to do any distance running.  

I live by the golden rule of mutual respect, and I also appreciate tidiness.  Your home is in good hands with me.  Smoke? No. Drink? Not so much.  Ohm nom nom? Oh hell yeah!!

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. I’ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. I’ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
I’ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. I’ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, I’ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my life’s experiences, I’ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: ‘Say what you will do and do what you will say.’

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. I’ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. I’ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
I’ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. I’ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, I’ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my life’s experiences, I’ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: ‘Say what you will do and do what you will say.’
