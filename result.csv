I moved to San Francisco in 1977; Charlie arrived in the 1960s. We still believe this is the best city in the world, despite its many difficult changes.

I am an outdoor person!  I roller skate all over town, and lead the weekly (world famous) San Francisco Friday Night Skate.  Charlie is an indoor person.  One of his favorite things to do is cook, and he's fabulous at it.

I occasionally have people for dinner. It is essential to understand that I am not a professional innkeeper. I am not running a bed and breakfast. I am an Airbnb host who accept guests to stay in my guest bedrooms. I want my guests to live like residents of San Francisco. My neighborhood is very popular.

We both grew up in the Bay Area and are college sweethearts having both majored in biological sciences. We chose to live and raise a family which includes our three children in San Francisco because of the beautiful landscape, amazing culture and diversity, priceless climate and lets not forget exploring this beautiful city through the iconic cable car rides.

As a family we enjoy spending most of our time outdoors which includes hiking in the Marin Headlands, breezy walks along Ocean Beach, as well as biking in Golden Gate Park to name a few. Camping is a major part of our summer routine in Lake Tahoe, Yosemite National Park, and Camp Mendocino. We also enjoy Lake Tahoe during the winter months for skiing and snowboarding. Noelle and I are also avid sports fans and LOVE attending San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Forty Niners, Oakland Raiders and San Jose Shark games with our children and friends. Our weekends are also consumed with youth sports as our children play on baseball, basketball, golf, and swimming teams.

 We are lucky enough to live in an area which embraces the arts and we are just a short stroll away from the many music festivals which San Francisco has to offer and a few of our favorite events to attend are the Blue Grass Festival and Outside Lands both in Golden Gate Park. 

San Francisco offers a variety of multi-cultural cuisine all within a short distance from each other whether it be a walk, drive or door step away. Some of our favorites include, fresh seafood, Pho, Mission-style burritos, Korean BBQ, Cioppino, or exploring our palates with tasting world renowned wine and cheese at the Ferry Building!

My name is Warren C. Lathe III, I go by Trey (a nickname, means ""3"" :). I am a career biologist (molecular genetics) though currently, I'm writing, teaching and other things (like Airbnb!). 

My partner in crime since 1996, and legal husband since 2008, is Guy and we have two school-age (middle and high schools) children (the picture here was 8 years ago :D). Guy is an English as a Second Language teacher by training and career, but now manages properties.

We have a long and deep connection to San Francisco. Guy is a Berryessa. The Berryessa's settled San Francisco and the bay in the 1770s coming with the De Anza party in 1776. His GGrandfather was Jose de los Santos Berryessa.  Guy's parents were married and lived in this city during the '40s (while his father fought in the Pacific theater). My own parents moved to the Bay Area in the 80's. Guy and I both moved into this home in 1997. San Francisco had been our dream city for its acceptance, tolerance, family heritage and its beauty. It has been our permanent home since (though my job took us to  Heidelberg Germany for four years ('99-'03) and DC for two ('12-'14).

Other than science and education, I'm a history, gardening, cooking and travel fanatic :). Guy loves traveling and design. Our eldest is all about acting, singing, make-up, friends, family and the indoors. Our younger is all about dance (Jazz, Modern, HipHop), building things, friends and the outdoors.

Between us we speak passable Korean (me), Swedish (Guy), German (both) and a bit of Spanish (Guy).

Looking forward to meeting you!
